# test-creds-show.sh — `make creds-show` must NEVER claim something that is not true in the CURRENT state.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (it is a gate born of a repeated failure, not a hypothetical)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# creds-show is the one command an operator trusts to tell them what exists and how to reach it. Three
# separate defects reached the OWNER — not me — because each fix was verified against THE DIFF instead of
# against THE WHOLE OUTPUT IN EVERY STATE:
#
#   1. it printed `.env.example` defaults (`harbor.vks.local`, `Harbor12345`) under the header "local demo
#      credentials" when NOTHING was installed — placeholders that look exactly like live credentials;
#   2. it singled out ArgoCD as `<not set>` while Harbor confidently printed an equally-unreal default, so
#      the table lied BY CONTRAST ("Harbor is configured, ArgoCD is not" — neither was);
#   3. it printed `http://gitea.vks.local` / `tekton` / the apps on a cluster with NO INGRESS — hosts that
#      nothing serves, and that no /etc/hosts entry can make work.
#
# Each was found only when a human read the whole table. A human reading the whole table is not a control.
# THIS is the control: render the command in each state and assert the invariant that the human was
# applying by eye — "every line must be TRUE right now".
#
# THE INVARIANT: creds-show may only advertise what the state supports.
#   * no state overlay      -> it must SAY the values are defaults (nothing is installed)
#   * no INGRESS_LB_IP      -> it must NOT print a *.vks.local URL (nothing serves those hosts)
#   * ingress present       -> it MUST print them (a gate that only ever checks the negative is half a gate)
#   * fully installed       -> no "not set"/"needs"/"default" markers at all

#
# It used to save/delete/restore the REAL sink, and that save-and-restore had two defects, both
# measured 2026-08-12:
#   1. IT DOWNGRADED THE MODE OF A SECRET FILE. `render()` does `rm -f "$SINK"` then recreates it
#      under the default umask, and `cp "$SAVED" "$SINK"` preserves the DESTINATION's mode — so a
#      0600 sink came back 0664. Measured exactly: 600 -> 664. `.env.state` holds the GENERATED
#      Harbor/Gitea/ArgoCD passwords, and this gate runs in `test-scripts` -> `static-check` ->
#      `make ci`, so every CI run on a box with a real sink left those passwords group- and
#      world-readable, permanently.
#   2. It raced anything else using the sink (a live lab walk publishes to it mid-run), and a
#      `kill -9` between delete and restore lost it outright.
# `state_file()` honours VKS_STATE_FILE (lib/state.sh), and it ships COMMENTED in .env.example, so
# exporting it here redirects every reader — the product's `load_env` included — at a temp file.
# Nothing of the operator's is touched, which is also why this gate is now safe to run during a walk.

# Nothing to put back any more — the sink IS ours. The old save/restore branch is deliberately gone
# rather than left inert: a guard that can never fire reads as a guarantee it does not give.

trap restore EXIT

# SKIP_DOTENV=1 IS LOAD-BEARING. Without it `load_env` sources the operator's real ./.env and
# ./.env.state, and the "no overlay" fixture below is no longer a no-overlay state at all: it
# inherits whatever that box has. MEASURED 2026-08-11 -- 6 of 6 assertions failed on a box whose
# .env carried HARBOR_URL=harbor.env1.lab.test and whose .env.state still held an INGRESS_LB_IP
# from a lab that had been DESTROYED. The same test passes in CI, where no .env exists, so the
# failure looks like a code regression and is a test that reads its own environment.
# ...AND SO IS SANDBOXING KUBECONFIG, for exactly the same reason one door along. creds.sh dials
# the cluster (`kubectl --request-timeout=3s version`, :198) and also probes for ArgoCD (:88-93), so
# an AMBIENT KUBECONFIG makes this "offline" suite reach a REAL cluster and its verdict depend on
# that cluster's state. MEASURED 2026-08-16: during a Supervisor Service uninstall the lab accepted
# TCP and then stalled, and `make ci` HUNG for 22+ minutes inside this file, in a target whose own
# help text says "Offline script-logic unit tests".
#
# --request-timeout is NOT at fault, and a `timeout` wrapper would have been the wrong fix.
# MEASURED at BOTH failure modes -- a packet-drop black hole (192.0.2.1) AND an accept-then-stall
# listener (a socket that accepts and never writes, which is what the lab was doing) -- kubectl
# exits at 3s in both. The 22 minutes is arithmetic, not a broken timeout: creds.sh makes ~2-3
# kubectl calls per case, this suite has 11 cases, and every one of them paid the full 3s.
#
# RED-PROVEN, with the confounder held constant (the lab had ALSO stopped stalling by then, so a
# plain re-run would have proved nothing): against the same accept-then-stall listener, this suite
# takes 0s WITH the sandbox and 78s WITHOUT it. Both exit 0 -- the defect was never a failure, it
# was an "offline" unit test quietly dialling a live cluster.
#
# A NONEXISTENT path rather than unsetting: it keeps `[ -n "$KUBECONFIG" ]` true, so the realistic
# "configured but unusable" branch is what gets exercised, and kubectl fails on stat in milliseconds.
# Per-case overrides (`KUBECONFIG="$_kc" render ...`) still win, which is how the one case that
# genuinely wants a kubeconfig keeps working.
