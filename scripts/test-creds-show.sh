#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-creds-show.sh — `make creds-show` must NEVER claim something that is not true in the CURRENT state.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (it is a gate born of a repeated failure, not a hypothetical)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# creds-show is the one command an operator trusts to tell them what exists and how to reach it. Three
# separate defects reached the OWNER — not me — because each fix was verified against THE DIFF instead of
# against THE WHOLE OUTPUT IN EVERY STATE:
#
#   1. it printed `.env.example` defaults (`harbor.vks.local`, `Harbor12345`) under the header "local demo
#      credentials" when NOTHING was installed — placeholders that look exactly like live credentials;
#   2. it singled out ArgoCD as `<not set>` while Harbor confidently printed an equally-unreal default, so
#      the table lied BY CONTRAST ("Harbor is configured, ArgoCD is not" — neither was);
#   3. it printed `http://gitea.vks.local` / `tekton` / the apps on a cluster with NO INGRESS — hosts that
#      nothing serves, and that no /etc/hosts entry can make work.
#
# Each was found only when a human read the whole table. A human reading the whole table is not a control.
# THIS is the control: render the command in each state and assert the invariant that the human was
# applying by eye — "every line must be TRUE right now".
#
# THE INVARIANT: creds-show may only advertise what the state supports.
#   * no state overlay      -> it must SAY the values are defaults (nothing is installed)
#   * no INGRESS_LB_IP      -> it must NOT print a *.vks.local URL (nothing serves those hosts)
#   * ingress present       -> it MUST print them (a gate that only ever checks the negative is half a gate)
#   * fully installed       -> no "not set"/"needs"/"default" markers at all
